/*
7. E_cv(reg*) is a biased estimator of E_test(reg*). Although E_test is evaluated over D_test,
and E_cv is evaluated over D_train, reg* itself is computed using D_train for both of them. In
order to make this unbiased, we need to compute reg* from one data set, E_cv(reg*) from a second data set,
and E_test(reg*) from a third.

7. E_cv(reg*) is a biased estimate of E_out, but it is an unbiased estimate of E_test(reg*).
This is because the act of choosing reg* causes bias since we are letting the data influence
our learning process. But since reg*, the factor that introduces bias, affects the results of both
E_cv(reg*) and E_test(reg*), there is no bias between the two. E_cv(reg*) is evaluated on the 
training data, and E_test(reg*) is evaluated on the test data.
